      "• Separate 2 modules with high power dissipation with a module of low power dissipation or by an empty space.\n",
      "• Mix modules with higher power dissipation and modules with less power dissipation.\n",
      "For example, modules with 16 outputs have a higher power dissipation than modules with 8 outputs.\n",
      "• You should give preference to the horizontal mounting position.\n",
      "• For vertical mounting position, plug modules with high power dissipation at the top, the interface module/CPU at the bottom.\n",
      "7.2 Installation conditions for motor starters\n",
      "• Mount an ET 200SP station with modules with high power dissipation in the lower area of the control cabinet.\n",
      "• For a multi-tier configuration, plug modules with high power dissipation on the sides so that the waste heat can rise to the top unhindered.\n",
      "• Avoid air movements at the terminals when using TC measurement with internal compensation.\n",
